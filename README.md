The computer should be connected to a VR headset to be provided with the upmost functionaries and the full experience that one would get from this virtual reality world. 

About this software:
This VR world provides you with a great tool to cope with anxiety by allowing immersion in a world where space and feel are the main focus.. When you enter the virtual world, the main menu is the first thing you will see. Here, you will see three options to choose from:

1. The heaven option will take you to a random forest-like space to immerse you in a more natural environment than usual. Here, you can sit and relax while involving your senses through natural sounds.
2. The Wander option will lead you to a new menu from which you choose to either go back to the main menu through the back button, or choose to go to another space namely The Room space. The Room is just a prototype of your comfortable space, so it can possibly be adjusted to your own comfort. This place is meant to give you space to calm down, sit with yourself and meditate on your current situation, or just to be in the moment, present with the help of a soothing background sound and motivational posters regarding anxiety.
3. Option 3 of the menu is the "leave" button which will display a message to you to confirm your choice of leaving the spaces and prompts you to take care.
